# gominiweb

A bare minimum go-based web server. Just exposes the currect directory on minimal web server.

I use it for sharing things for a few minutes from notebooks, phones, etc...

Just build it with "go build", and you're good to go.

Or, there are ready-made binaries here too, that you can just grab and use, like:

	wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kkovacs/gominiweb/master/gominiweb-armel

Usage:

	Usage of ./gominiweb:
	-p=7000: port to listen on (default: 7000)
